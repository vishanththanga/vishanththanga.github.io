      <h1>
        Vasili Arkhipov
      </h1>
      <time datetime="10-13-2019">Oct 13, 2019, 7:21 AM</time>
      <p></p>
      <p>
          I've always loved history, specifically U.S. history.
        </p>

        <p>
          The U.S.'s history has unfolded in recent times and something
          interesting is always happening with the U.S.
        </p>

        <p>Take <b>October 27, 1962</b>, for example.</p>

        <p>
          This day was the peak of the Cuban Missile Crisis between the U.S. and
          the Soviet Union, who were in an arms race to be the world's dominant
          force.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Soviet B-59 submarine was ordered to stop near an American blockade.
          After being spotted by American forces, the B-59 submerged themselves
          to conceal their presence but lost all communication in the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          The U.S. forces tried to get the Soviets to resurface by dropping
          non-lethal depth charges. What the U.S. didn't know was that the B-59
          had nuclear weapons that were ready to be fired under any reasonable
          circumstance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The team in the B-59 was panicking.
        </p>

        <p>
            They had no communication with their
            command, and the temperatures in the submarine were above 40 degrees
            celsius. To top it off, the Soviets feared the U.S. depth charges were
            the first strikes in a nuclear war.
          </p>

        <p>
          That's when one of the Soviet captains said fuck it:
        </p>

        <h3>
          We're gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them
          all - we will not become the shame of the fleet.
        </h3>
        <p></p>

        <p>
          But in order to attack, he needed the B-59's other two captains to sign off.
          The 2nd captain said yes, <b>the third said no.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          That third captain was a man named <b>Vasili Arkhipov</b>, and he's
          the most important person in history you don't know.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keeping a level-head, Vasili calmed down the other two captains and
          explained that the ship was not in danger, but being told to surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The B-59 resurfaced and found no nuclear war taking place. Vasili was
          right.
        </p>

        <p>
            He also saved the world from WWIII, a war that probably would
            have ended humanity.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Note 1: What happened within the B-59 didn't become public knowledge until 2002 (40 years later). It makes you think about how many other stories like this we still haven't heard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note 2: If you're interested in U.S. history, I would recommend checking out Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States. One of my favourite tv series.

      <h1>Life is a single-player game</h1>
      <time datetime="10-10-2019">Oct. 10, 2019, 5:34 AM</time>
      <p></p>
      <p>
          This tweet has been on my mind recently:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
          <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Life is a single player game.</p>
          &mdash; Naval (@naval)
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/806034795658522624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"
            >December 6, 2016</a
          >
        </blockquote>
        <script
          async
          src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
          charset="utf-8"
        ></script>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            Initially, I saw the timestamp and wondered what made Naval tweet this
            at 3:17 am...
        </p>

        <p>
          But after giving this idea some thought, I came up with my own
          interpretation:
        </p>

        <p>Most competition is <b>mimetic.</b></p>

        <p>
          It's weird, but only by observing other people do we learn how and
          what to desire. We then will equate their desires as a necessity for
          survival, so we learn how to compete by imitating the people around
          us.
        </p>

        <p>
          After we understand what "we" want and knowing how to compete, we will
          fight for the same finite resources to fulfill "our" desires.
        </p>

        <p>
          A crude example would be a baby wanting the toy that they see another
          baby playing with.
        </p>

        <p>
          So society has places to teach us how to use our mimetic nature and
          compete against each other. School, the corporate world, and sports
          are all examples of these places. But these are
          <b>multi-player games.</b> They are often zero-sum,
          <a href="https://nav.al/seek-wealth" target="_blank">status games</a>,
          but deemed necessary by society.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the problem- we make up hyper-competitive, multi-player games
          that don't need to exist. These games are probably made up because
          it's the brain's default programming to maximize one's ability to
          fulfill "their" desires. We think that more competitive = better
          ability to filter weak people and claim scarce resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll never forget when my friend told me how she was sick and missed
          school, so she asked one of her classmates for notes to study for a
          test. The girl gives my friend the notes, and they write the test. My
          friend fails and then finds out that the girl gave her fake notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yeah, you didn't read that wrong, someone actually took the time to
          make fake notes and distribute them.
        </p>

        <p>
          You really can't <i>win</i> these multi-player games for multiple
          reasons:
        </p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li class="extra-space">
            There will probably always be someone better than you at the game
            you're playing.
          </li>
          <li class="extra-space">
            The journey to <i>winning</i> would probably suck. Do you really
            want to deal with fake notes? That's just shitty.
          </li>
          <li class="extra-space">
            Your happiness is predicated on external validators. Not sustainable
            or healthy.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>

        <p>
          Even if you think you've <i>won</i>, the saying,
          <b>"play stupid games, win stupid prizes"</b> definitely applies here.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is where the single-player stuff Naval talked about comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am the happiest I've ever been since I've started playing single-player games.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the happiness is rooted in me doing what I want to do with
          <b>incentive structures I've chosen.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          A recent example of how I've been spending my time has been learning
          to play poker. I wanted to learn how to play because I enjoy the
          strategy involved and problem-solving. Status & money could be
          byproducts. Or maybe they won't be, doesn't really matter to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          So the path to being happy & fulfilled looks like this for me:
          understanding what I want, why I want that, and just doing those
          things. I believe I'm ultimately responsible for my own happiness.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          Note 1: I do think that parts of life will be
          <i>co-op missions.</i> Starting a family and raising children
          shouldn't be a solo game, haha.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note 2: I would admit that what I've chosen to spend my time doing has
          been partially influenced by my environment. But 2 things: 1)
          Imitation isn't binary to me, it's a scale of how much you imitate. 2)
          Imitation itself isn't <i>bad</i>, it's really just a vehicle. I would
          think about how it's being used and what the incentive behind a desire
          is.

            Goals
          </h1>
    
          <time datetime="10-07-2019">Oct 7, 2019, 3:34 AM</time>
          <p></p>
          <p>
              So recently, I've been talking to a ton of adults to understand their
              life aspirations. The results blew my mind.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Most of them didn't have a clear sense of what they wanted from life.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              <b>I was like what!?</b>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              I thought about why that was, and here's what I concluded:
              <b>people will run the "race" of life like a chicken with their head
                cut off.</b>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              Based on my conversations, I've depicted how most will "run:"
            </p>
    
            <p class="size-2" style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/goals1.png"></p>
    
            <p>Excuse my messiness, but it just doesn't make sense to me.</p>
    
            <p>
              I had one guy tell me, word for word,
              <i>"I had a midlife crisis when I was 44 because I just didn't know
                what I wanted and started to feel existential angst."</i>
              The saying
              <b>"if you don't know what you want, any path will take you there" is
                real.</b>
            </p>
    
            <p>
              But what if you just flipped how you thought about what you wanted in
              life? If you could think about what you wanted and work backwards? It
              would look something like this:
            </p>
    
            <p class="size-2" style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/goals2.png"></p>
    
            <p>
              Hypothetically, by the time I die, I want to have:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
              <li class="extra-space">Travelled to 30 countries</li></ul><ul><li class="extra-space"><span style="color: white;">Start a company with a meaningful impact</span></li></ul><ul>
              <li class="extra-space">
                Grew a beard (mine comes in shitty, so this is a real goal haha)</li>
            </ul><div><font color="#ffffff"><span style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></font></div>
    
            <p>
              I now know what the end looks like so I can work backward:
            </p>
    
            <p class="size-2" style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/goals3.png"></p>
    
            <p>
              I start to have items I can do and are realistic to accomplish at each
              mark based on my end goals.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              If I want to travel to 30 countries before I die:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>In 5 years, I will want to have gone to 5 countries.</li></ul><div><font color="#ffffff"><span style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></font></div><ul>

              <li>
                Finally, by the end of today (or at "start"), I will have chosen
                where I want to go.
              </li>
            </ul><div><font color="#ffffff"><span style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></font></div><div><font color="#ffffff"><span style="caret-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></font></div>
    
            <p>
              The year and month benchmarks are arbitrary; you'll have to find a
              system that works best for you. But the idea remains the same, If you
              want something:
            </p>
    
            <ol type="1">
              <li class="extra-space">
                Be able to identify what is (make the goal as measurable as
                possible)
              </li>
              <li class="extra-space">
                Want it badly (be relentless in achieving your goal)
              </li>
              <li class="extra-space">
                Make sure it is realistic; it would be unrealistic for me to say I
                want to travel to 30 countries in 1 month
              </li>
            </ol>
    
            <p></p>
            <p>Unfortunately, this system isn't as easy to implement as it sounds.
              Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
    
            <ol type="1">
              <li class="extra-space">
                You may not always know what you want. This week I graduated high
                school and was talking to people about what their plans were. Most
                people responded with going to university and not knowing anything
                beyond that. As an 18-year-old, I recognize it can be hard to
                understand, but what I thought was also interesting was how
                comfortable a lot of my friends' lives were. They didn't want to try
                new things or explore what they didn't know. The way I've started to
                develop an understanding of who I want to be has been seeking new,
                unique experiences. So try new stuff.
              </li>
              <li class="extra-space">
                I understand that life will be complicated and throw curveballs at
                you. Say in my plan to travel to a country in a year, eight months
                down the line, I have an emergency and can't go on the trip anymore.
                That doesn't mean you failed life or the system doesn't work, you
                adjust your goals. That's it.
              </li>

                Creating a goal today doesn't mean it will still be one in 5 years.
                People and their subsequent goals are allowed to change and grow, so
                the ability to adapt will be crucial. I like to reevaluate my goals
                at a consistent interval to see how I'm feeling.

                Planning ≠ mitigating risk. I'd advocate doing more of the opposite.
                Take risks, create serendipity, and be spontaneous within your
                goals. What I hope to do with my goal-setting is to give myself
                long-term clarity. On an average day, when I wake up, I know what
                gets me up.

              That's it. Now create expectations for yourself.
