        <p>
          I've always loved history, specifically U.S. history.
        </p>

        <p>
          The U.S.'s history has unfolded in recent times and something
          interesting is always happening with the U.S.
        </p>

        <p>Take <b>October 27, 1962</b>, for example.</p>

        <p>
          This day was the peak of the Cuban Missile Crisis between the U.S. and
          the Soviet Union, who were in an arms race to be the world's dominant
          force.
        </p>

        <p>
          A Soviet B-59 submarine was ordered to stop near an American blockade.
          After being spotted by American forces, the B-59 submerged themselves
          to conceal their presence but lost all communication in the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          The U.S. forces tried to get the Soviets to resurface by dropping
          non-lethal depth charges. What the U.S. didn't know was that the B-59
          had nuclear weapons that were ready to be fired under any reasonable
          circumstance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The team in the B-59 was panicking.
        </p>

        <p>
            They had no communication with their
            command, and the temperatures in the submarine were above 40 degrees
            celsius. To top it off, the Soviets feared the U.S. depth charges were
            the first strikes in a nuclear war.
          </p>

        <p>
          That's when one of the Soviet captains said fuck it:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          We're gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them
          all - we will not become the shame of the fleet.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          But he needed the B-59's other two captains to sign off on an attack.
          The 2nd captain said yes, <b>but the third said no.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          That third captain was a man named <b>Vasili Arkhipov</b>, and he's
          the most important person in history you don't know.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keeping a level-head, Vasili calmed down the other two captains and
          explained that the ship was not in danger, but being told to surface.
        </p>

        <p>
          The B-59 resurfaced and found no nuclear war taking place. Vasili was
          right.
        </p>

        <p>
            He also saved the world from WWIII, a war that probably would
            have ended humanity.
        </p>

          ---
        </p>

        <p>
            Note 1: What happened within the B-59 didn't become public knowledge until 2002 (40 years later). It makes you think about how many other stories like this we still haven't heard.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note 2: If you're interested in U.S. history, I would recommend checking out Oliver Stone's Untold History of the United States. One of my favourite tv series.
