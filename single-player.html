          This tweet has been on my mind recently:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

        <p>
            Initially, I saw the timestamp and wondered what made Naval tweet this
            at 3:17 am...
        </p>

        <p>
          But after giving this idea some thought, I came up with my own
          interpretation:
        </p>

        <p>Most competition is <b>mimetic.</b></p>

        <p>
          It's weird, but only by observing other people do we learn how and
          what to desire. We then will equate their desires as a necessity for
          survival, so we learn how to compete by imitating the people around
          us.
        </p>

        <p>
          After we understand what "we" want and knowing how to compete, we will
          fight for the same finite resources to fulfill "our" desires.
        </p>

        <p>
          A crude example would be a baby wanting the toy that they see another
          baby playing with.
        </p>

        <p>
          So society has places to teach us how to use our mimetic nature and
          compete against each other. School, the corporate world, and sports
          are all examples of these places. But these are
          <b>multi-player games.</b> They are often zero-sum,
          <a href="https://nav.al/seek-wealth" target="_blank">status games</a>,
          but deemed necessary by society.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here's the problem- we make up hyper-competitive, multi-player games
          that don't need to exist. These games are probably made up because
          it's the brain's default programming to maximize one's ability to
          fulfill "their" desires. We think that more competitive = better
          ability to filter weak people and claim scarce resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll never forget when my friend told me how she was sick and missed
          school, so she asked one of her classmates for notes to study for a
          test. The girl gives my friend the notes, and they write the test. My
          friend fails and then finds out that the girl gave her fake notes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yeah, you didn't read that wrong, someone actually took the time to
          make fake notes and distribute them.
        </p>

        <p>
          You really can't <i>win</i> these multi-player games for multiple
          reasons:
        </p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li class="extra-space">
            There will probably always be someone better than you at the game
            you're playing.
          </li>
          <li class="extra-space">
            The journey to <i>winning</i> would probably suck. Do you really
            want to deal with fake notes? That's just shitty.
          </li>
          <li class="extra-space">
            Your happiness is predicated on external validators. Not sustainable
            or healthy.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p></p>

        <p>
          Even if you think you've <i>won</i>, the saying,
          <b>"play stupid games, win stupid prizes"</b> definitely applies here.
        </p>

        <p>
          But this is where the single-player stuff Naval talked about comes in.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am the happiest I've ever been since I've started playing single-player games.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the happiness is rooted in me doing what I want to do with
          <b>incentive structures I've chosen.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
          A recent example of how I've been spending my time has been learning
          to play poker. I wanted to learn how to play because I enjoy the
          strategy involved and problem-solving. Status & money could be
          byproducts. Or maybe they won't be, doesn't really matter to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          So the path to being happy & fulfilled looks like this for me:
          understanding what I want, why I want that, and just doing those
          things. I believe I'm ultimately responsible for my own happiness.

        <p>
          Note 1: I do think that parts of life will be
          <i>co-op missions.</i> Starting a family and raising children
          shouldn't be a solo game, haha.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note 2: I would admit that what I've chosen to spend my time doing has
          been partially influenced by my environment. But 2 things: 1)
          Imitation isn't binary to me, it's a scale of how much you imitate. 2)
          Imitation itself isn't <i>bad</i>, it's really just a vehicle. I would
          think about how it's being used and what the incentive behind a desire
          is.
